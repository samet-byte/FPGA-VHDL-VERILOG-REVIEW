**Questions**

1. A student takes four courses, A, B, C and D. The studentâ€™s success in the course is indicated with 1, and the cases where he/she fails are indicated with 0. The success of this student is defined by F and the conditions for being successful are as follows;
   - In order for a student to be considered successful, he/she must be successful in at least three courses.
   -	One of the successful  courses must be B course.

``` VHDL
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;


entity deneme1 is
    Port ( S : in STD_LOGIC;
           K : in STD_LOGIC;
           D : in STD_LOGIC;
           B : out STD_LOGIC);
end deneme1;

architecture Behavioral of deneme1 is

begin
B<=(K NOR D) NOR ((NOT S) NOR D); 

end Behavioral;
