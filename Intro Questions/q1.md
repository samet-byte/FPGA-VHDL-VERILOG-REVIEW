1. A student takes four courses, A, B, C and D. The student’s success in the course is indicated with 1, and the cases where he/she fails are indicated with 0. The success of this student is defined by F and the conditions for being successful are as follows;
   - In order for a student to be considered successful, he/she must be successful in at least three courses.
   -	One of the successful  courses must be B course.
